# Calculating the area of triangles with Monte Carlo
This is a project made in a **Python Introduction Course** during my **Master in Data Analytics**.
The program receives from the user the coordinates of the vertices of a triangle (for example, a triangle could be [[1, 1], [5, 4], [2, 7]]) and determines its area using the Monte Carlo method.
